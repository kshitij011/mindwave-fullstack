    content: "Here are five challenging Solidity questions tailored for an expert:  \n\n1. **Reentrancy Attacks**: How can a contract vulnerable to reentrancy be exploited, and what are the best practices to prevent it without relying on `ReentrancyGuard`?  \n\n2. **Gas Optimization**: Explain how struct packing and variable ordering in storage can reduce gas costs, and provide an example where improper ordering leads to wasted slots.  \n\n3. **Delegatecall Risks**: What are the critical security risks when using `delegatecall`, and how can a malicious actor exploit it to hijack a contractâ€™s storage?  \n\n4. **ERC-20 vs. ERC-777**: How does ERC-777â€™s hook mechanism introduce potential security risks that donâ€™t exist in ERC-20, and what precautions should developers take?  \n\n5. **Upgradeable Contracts**: Describe how storage collisions can occur in upgradeable proxy patterns (e.g., Transparent vs. UUPS), and how can they be mitigated?  \n\nAnswer concisely, and Iâ€™ll evaluate your responses afterward."
